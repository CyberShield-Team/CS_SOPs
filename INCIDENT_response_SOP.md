1. Introduction:

Security incidents can pose significant risks to our organization's operations, data, and reputation. Prompt and accurate reporting of security incidents is essential for timely response and mitigation.

2. Incident Classification:

Incidents should be classified based on their severity and impact to prioritize response efforts. The following classification levels are used:

- Critical: Incidents causing severe disruption to operations or compromising critical data.
- Major: Incidents with significant impact but less severe than critical incidents.
- Minor: Incidents causing minimal disruption or impact.

3. Incident Reporting Procedure:

    1. Identification: Any employee who detects or suspects a security incident must immediately report it to the designated Incident Response Team (IRT) or Security Operations Center (SOC).
    2. Initial Assessment: Upon receiving an incident report, the IRT/SOC conducts an initial assessment to determine the nature and severity of the incident.
    3. Incident Documentation: The IRT/SOC documents the incident details, including the date, time, location, description, and initial assessment findings.
    4. Notification: If necessary, the IRT/SOC notifies relevant stakeholders, including management, IT, legal, and compliance teams, based on the incident severity.
    5. Containment: The IRT/SOC takes immediate actions to contain the incident and prevent further damage or compromise.
    6. Investigation: A thorough investigation is conducted to identify the root cause, extent of impact, and potential vulnerabilities exploited.
    7. Resolution: The IRT/SOC implements corrective measures to resolve the incident and restore affected systems or services.
    8. Post-Incident Review: After the incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and identify lessons learned.
4. Escalation Process:
- Incidents should be escalated to higher levels of management or specialized teams based on their severity and complexity.
- The escalation path includes designated personnel or teams responsible for handling specific types of incidents.
5. Contact Information:
- Incident Response Team (IRT): Cyber Shield
- Security Operations Center (SOC): Cyber Shield HQ. 35th st. Manhattan, NY 10016
- Management: Joe Gutman, Seyed Hashemi.

6. Documentation:
- All incident reports, assessments, and resolutions must be documented in detail using the organization's incident reporting template.
- Documentation should include timestamps, actions taken, findings, and recommendations for future prevention.
7. Review and Update:
- This SOP should be reviewed periodically to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.
- Updates may be necessary to incorporate changes in incident response procedures, contact information, or organizational structure.
