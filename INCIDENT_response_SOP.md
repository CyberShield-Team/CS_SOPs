1. Introduction:

Security incidents can pose significant risks to our organization's operations, data, and reputation. Prompt and accurate reporting of security incidents is essential for timely response and mitigation.

2. Incident Classification:

Incidents should be classified based on their severity and impact to prioritize response efforts. The following classification levels are used:

Critical: Incidents causing severe disruption to operations or compromising critical data.
Major: Incidents with significant impact but less severe than critical incidents.
Minor: Incidents causing minimal disruption or impact.

3. Incident Reporting Procedure:

Identification: Any employee who detects or suspects a security incident must immediately report it to the designated Incident Response Team (IRT) or Security Operations Center (SOC).
Initial Assessment: Upon receiving an incident report, the IRT/SOC conducts an initial assessment to determine the nature and severity of the incident.
Incident Documentation: The IRT/SOC documents the incident details, including the date, time, location, description, and initial assessment findings.
Notification: If necessary, the IRT/SOC notifies relevant stakeholders, including management, IT, legal, and compliance teams, based on the incident severity.
Containment: The IRT/SOC takes immediate actions to contain the incident and prevent further damage or compromise.
Investigation: A thorough investigation is conducted to identify the root cause, extent of impact, and potential vulnerabilities exploited.
Resolution: The IRT/SOC implements corrective measures to resolve the incident and restore affected systems or services.
Post-Incident Review: After the incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and identify lessons learned.
4. Escalation Process:
Incidents should be escalated to higher levels of management or specialized teams based on their severity and complexity.
The escalation path includes designated personnel or teams responsible for handling specific types of incidents.
