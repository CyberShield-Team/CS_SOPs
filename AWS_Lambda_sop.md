# AWS Lambda Security Alerts and Automations - Statement of Purpose (SOP)

## Objective:

This SOP outlines the mission, objectives, and standard operating procedures for utilizing AWS Lambda in the context of security alerts and automations at [Your Organization Name]. The purpose is to establish robust practices for monitoring Lambda functions, detecting security incidents, and implementing automated responses to enhance the overall security posture.

## Scope:

This SOP is applicable to all teams and individuals responsible for the development, deployment, and maintenance of Lambda functions within Cyber Shield. It encompasses activities related to security monitoring, incident response, and automation.

## Mission and Objectives:
1.  Mission:
        
        To ensure the security of AWS Lambda functions by implementing effective monitoring, timely detection of security incidents, and automated responses to mitigate risks.
2. Objectives:

        - Establish comprehensive security monitoring for Lambda functions.
        - Detect and respond promptly to security incidents.
        - Implement automated responses to common security threats.
        - Continuously improve security alerting and automation processes.
        - Foster a security-aware culture within Lambda development and operations teams.
## Roles and Responsibilities:

1. Security Monitoring:

    - Configure CloudWatch Alarms to monitor critical metrics, such as function errors, duration, and invocation rates.
    - Implement custom CloudWatch Metrics to track specific security-related events.
    - Set up CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging and monitoring.
2. Incident Detection and Response:

    - Establish predefined security incident response plans for Lambda functions.
    - Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger Lambda functions for immediate incident response.
    - Define escalation paths and communication channels for security incidents.
3. Automated Responses:

    - Develop Lambda functions to automate responses to security incidents.
    - Implement automated actions such as blocking malicious IP addresses, rotating compromised credentials, or terminating compromised instances.
    - Integrate Lambda functions with AWS Step Functions for orchestrated incident response.
4. Continuous Improvement:

    - Regularly review and update security monitoring configurations based on emerging threats.
    - Conduct post-incident reviews to identify areas for improvement in incident response procedures.
    - Iterate on automated response mechanisms to enhance effectiveness.
5. Documentation:

    - Maintain detailed documentation for security monitoring configurations.
    - Document incident response plans, including roles and responsibilities.
    - Update documentation in response to changes in Lambda functions or security configurations.
6. Training and Awareness:

    - Conduct regular training sessions on security best practices for Lambda development and operations teams.
    - Foster a culture of security awareness and proactive threat mitigation.
7. Integration with AWS Security Services:

    - Leverage AWS Security Hub, AWS Config, and other relevant services for additional security insights.
    - Integrate Lambda functions with AWS CloudTrail for auditing and tracking API calls.
8. Review and Approval:

    This SOP is subject to periodic review and requires approval from the Cyber Shield Team to ensure alignment with organizational security policies, industry standards, and best practices.
