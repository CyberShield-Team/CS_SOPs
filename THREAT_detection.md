## 
1. Introduction:

Threat detection is essential for identifying and mitigating security risks before they cause significant harm to the organization's assets and operations. This SOP outlines procedures for proactive threat detection.

2. Threat Intelligence Sources:
    1. External Sources:

        - Utilize reputable threat intelligence feeds, such as CERT, ISACs, and commercial threat intelligence providers.
        - Regularly monitor industry-specific threat reports and bulletins.
    2. Internal Sources:

        - Analyze internal logs, incident reports, and security alerts for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
        - Encourage employees to report suspicious activities or phishing attempts.
3. Monitoring Tools:
    1. Network Monitoring:

        - Implement network monitoring tools (e.g., intrusion detection/prevention systems, packet analyzers) to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns or anomalies.
        - Configure alerts for unusual network behavior.
    2. Endpoint Monitoring:

        - Deploy endpoint protection solutions (e.g., antivirus, endpoint detection and response) to monitor endpoints for signs of malware or unauthorized access.
        - Enable endpoint logging and monitoring capabilities.
4. Anomaly Detection:
    1. Baseline Establishment:

        - Establish baseline behavior for network and system activities.
        - Identify deviations from the baseline that may indicate potential security threats.
    2. Anomaly Detection Techniques:

        - Utilize statistical analysis, machine learning, and behavioral analytics to detect anomalies in network and system behavior.
        - Configure anomaly detection algorithms in monitoring tools to trigger alerts for suspicious activities.
5. Incident Triage:
    1. Alert Prioritization:

        - Prioritize alerts based on severity, impact, and relevance to organizational assets and operations.
        - Classify alerts as critical, high, medium, or low priority.
    2. Initial Assessment:

        - Conduct initial assessments of alerts to determine if they represent genuine security threats or false positives.
        - Investigate alerts promptly to prevent potential security incidents.
6. Threat Hunting:
    1. Proactive Investigation:

        - Conduct proactive threat hunting activities to search for hidden threats or indicators of compromise within the network and systems.
        - Utilize threat hunting tools, techniques, and methodologies to identify and mitigate security risks.
    2. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:

        - Collaborate with threat intelligence teams, incident response teams, and external partners to share insights and best practices for threat hunting.
        - Document and share findings from threat hunting activities to improve overall threat detection capabilities.
7. Regular Security Audits:
    1. Scheduled Audits:

        - Conduct regular security audits of network infrastructure, systems, and applications to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
        - Use automated scanning tools and manual techniques to perform comprehensive audits.
    2. Vulnerability Management:

        - Prioritize and remediate identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact on the organization.
        - Implement patches, updates, and security controls to mitigate vulnerabilities.
8. Documentation:
    1. Incident Reports:

        - Document all detected threats, alerts, and incidents in detail using the organization's incident reporting template.
        - Include timestamps, alert details, investigation findings, and remediation actions taken.
    2. Threat Intelligence Reports:

        - Document findings from threat intelligence sources, including indicators of compromise (IOCs), threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and recommended mitigation measures.

9. Review and Update:
- Regularly review and update this SOP to incorporate changes in threat detection technologies, tools, and best practices.
- Conduct periodic training sessions for employees involved in threat detection to ensure adherence to the SOP.
