1. Introduction:

Mitigation involves implementing measures to reduce or eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities identified within the organization's systems, networks, and processes.

2. Threat Assessment:
    1. Identify Vulnerabilities:
        - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments using automated scanning tools and manual techniques.
        Identify vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact on the organization's operations.
    2. Risk Analysis:
        - Assess the likelihood and potential impact of exploitation for each identified vulnerability.
        Prioritize vulnerabilities based on their risk level to focus mitigation efforts effectively.
3. Mitigation Procedures:
    - Patch Management:
        1. Develop a patch management process to promptly apply security patches for known vulnerabilities.
        2. Schedule regular patching cycles for systems and applications, prioritizing critical patches.
    - Configuration Management:
        1. Implement secure configuration baselines for systems, networks, and applications.
        2. Regularly review and update configurations to align with security best practices and compliance requirements.
    - Access Control:
        1. Enforce least privilege access control principles to restrict user permissions and limit exposure to sensitive resources.
        2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts and critical systems.
    - Network Security:
        1. Deploy firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other network security controls to monitor and protect network traffic.
        2. Segment network environments to contain and mitigate the impact of potential breaches.
    - Incident Response Planning:
        1. Develop and maintain an incident response plan outlining procedures for responding to security incidents.
        2. Conduct regular incident response drills and exercises to validate the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
4. Escalation Paths:
    - Levels of Escalation:
        - Level 1:
            IT support team.
            Security operations center (SOC) analysts.
        - Level 2:
            1. Incident Response Team (IRT) members.
            2. Departmental managers.
        - Level 3:
            1. Executive management.
            2. Legal department.
            3. External incident response consultants if necessary.

6. Documentation:

Document all mitigation activities, including vulnerability assessments, patching efforts, configuration changes, and incident response actions. Maintain records of vulnerabilities identified, mitigation measures implemented, and lessons learned.

7. Review and Update:

Regularly review and update this SOP to reflect changes in the threat landscape, organizational structure, or technology environment. Incorporate feedback from incident response exercises and post-incident reviews to improve mitigation procedures.
